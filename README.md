# Global Happiness Analysis
## Project Overview
### This repository examines six factors that may or may not influence global happiness using statitsical modeling, regression analysis, and geospatial visualization. 
### The purpose of the project is to identify key drivers of happiness and present findings in a Tableau Storyboard. Using supervised and unsupervised modeling, 
### the analysis detects patterns in happiness scores based on GDP per capita, social support, freedom to make choices, life expectancy, and others. The analysis offers
### stakeholders, primarily policy-holders, a different set of criteria to utilize when strategizing and developing policies intended to benefit its citizens.
### Leading experts across different fields describe how measurements of well-being can be effectively used to evaluate the progress of nations and that happiness indicators can inform policy-making decisions.
## Data Sources
### Primary dataset: The World Happiness Report dataset is sourced from Kaggle, where the happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll
### collected by Sustainable Development Solutions Network of the United Nations.

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
# Examined overall trends in global happiness rankings from 2015-2024. 
### Created visualizations for key influencing factors, including GDP per capita and social support.
## 2. Regression Analysis
### Applied linear regression models to determine the strongest predictors of happiness.
### Investigated correlation between GDP per capita and happiness scores.
## 3. Geospatial Analysis
### Created chloropleth maps to visualize happiness scores across countries and regions.
### Identified regional disparities in happiness and economic status. 
## 4. Final Recommendations
### Derived data-driven insights geared towards policy makers to improve national well-being.
